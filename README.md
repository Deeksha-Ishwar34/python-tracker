  My Python Tracker 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a 1st-year CSE student and a beginner in Python. This repository is where I share all the small projects Iâ€™m working on as I learn Python.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s in this repo? 
- Beginner-friendly Python mini projects  
- Simple programs to learn core concepts  
- My journey of exploring, practicing, and growing!

  
Iâ€™m using this space to track my progress, improve my coding skills, and share my learning journey with others. Feel free to explore and learn with me!
 

Stay tuned for more mini projects as I continue to learn and build. Letâ€™s grow together!

Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜Š
